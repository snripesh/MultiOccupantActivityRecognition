# MultiOccupantActivityRecognition

Multi-occupant recognition and real-time fall detection are essential in the quickly expanding field of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) to ensure resident's safety and well-being, especially those who are elderly or physically disabled. In order to enable precise multi-occupant activity recognition and efficient fall detection in AAL environments, this work suggests a novel method that blends laptop-based sensory inputs with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.
